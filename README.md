This Python code uses the Pygame and Pygame-menu libraries to create a simple interactive menu for several movie theater chains.

Libraries Used
The following libraries are imported:

pygame: A Python library used for creating games and multimedia applications.
pygame_menu: A Pygame library used for creating menus and pop-ups.
Themes
Two custom themes are created and used for the menus. Each theme has a background image and custom font colors.

Menus
The code contains several menus, including:

Main Menu: The first menu that the user sees, with buttons for each theater chain and a button to exit the program.
Shaw: A menu with buttons to display pricing information for Shaw theaters.
GV: A menu with buttons to display pricing information, venue locations, and benefits of going to GV theaters.
Eng Wah: A menu with buttons to display pricing information for Eng Wah theaters.
Cathay: A menu with buttons to display pricing information for Cathay theaters.
Map: A menu with an image of a cinema map.
The pricing information menus display the cost of tickets for different days and times, as well as special rates for students and seniors.

Running the Code
To run this code, ensure that the Pygame and Pygame-menu libraries are installed. Then, run the Python script. The main menu will appear and the user can navigate through the menus by clicking on the buttons. To exit the program, click the "Quit" button on the main menu.
